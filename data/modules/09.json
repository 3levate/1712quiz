    "explanation": "Server-based architecture has the server do all four application functions. Client-based architecture has the client do the presentation logic. As the client in server-based architecture has less control over the logic of the system, server-based architecture is more secure."

So each gets a \"dumb terminal\", all connected to just one computer.<br>- While less common today, theyâ€™re still important, especially where systems process a huge amount of transactions or require a huge amount of security."
