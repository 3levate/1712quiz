# COMP-1712 Practice Quiz

Run `index.html` using vscode's Live Preview. (Just opening the file with a browser won't work!)

Compared to Learning Hub's version:

Pros:

- Faster because everything is local.
- You can combine multiple modules into one quiz.
- You can choose how many questions per attempt.

Cons:

- By using this app you agree to wear a Hawaiian shirt to the exam.
