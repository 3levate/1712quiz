# COMP 1712 Practice Quiz

<https://quiz.comp1712.ca>

## Features

All questions and answers are taken from Learning Hub practice quizzes (732 in total), but the front-end is homemade from scratch, with better UI/UX and more advanced features:

- Has dark mode (thanks [Justin](https://github.com/JCardas))
- Much faster to submit a quiz (1-2s on Learning Hub, versus instantaneous)
- Much faster to start a new quiz (several clicks on Learning Hub, versus 1)
- Can combine multiple modules into one quiz
- Can choose how many questions per quiz, up to the entire question bank
- Unable to finish the quiz? Just submit, unanswered questions don't count.
- Questions you've answered correctly won't appear in future quizzes.
- The quiz page containing all questions and answers can be printed to pdf.
- You can submit explanations for quiz questions, or learn from the explanations of your classmates. Currently 235 / 732 questions (~32%) have explanations.
